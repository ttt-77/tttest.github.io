<p>Code injection is the exploitation of a computer bug that is caused by processing invalid data. It is used by an attacker to introduce (or "inject") code into a vulnerable computer program and change the course of execution. The result of successful code injection can be disastrous, for example, by allowing computer viruses or computer worms to propagate.</p>

<p>Code injection vulnerabilities occur when an application sends untrusted data to an interpreter. Injection flaws are most often found in SQL, LDAP, XPath, NoSQL queries, OS commands, XML parsers, SMTP headers, program arguments, etc.</p>

<p>Injection can result in data loss or corruption, lack of accountability, or denial of access. Injection can sometimes lead to complete host takeover.</p>

<p>Code injection techniques are popular in system hacking or cracking to gain information, privilege escalation or unauthorized access to a system. Code injection can be used malevolently for many purposes, including arbitrarily modifying values in a database through SQL injection, installing malware or executing malevolent code on a server by injecting server scripting code, privilege escalation to root permissions by exploiting Shell Injection vulnerabilities, and attacking web users with HTML/script injection (Cross-site scripting).</p>

<p>Code injection may also be used with good intentions; for example, changing or tweaking the behavior of a program or system through code injection can cause the system to behave in a certain way without any malicious intent.</p>

<p>To prevent code injection problems, secure input and output handling should be utilized, such as using APIs that are secure against all input characters, enforcing language separation via a static type system, input validation, input encoding, and output encoding.</p>

<p>The page also provides examples of different types of code injection, such as SQL injection, Cross-site scripting, Server Side Template Injection, Dynamic evaluation vulnerabilities, Object injection, Remote file injection, Format specifier injection, and Shell injection.</p>
